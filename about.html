                 Spencer Wade began drawing when he was two years old. By the time he was three his sketch series 
                 Spaghetti Sauce on kitchen wall won national aclaim. He is currently studying art at Macalester
                 College in Saint Paul Minnesota. Currently he paints in the basement of Berkeley Haus primarily using uncut oils
                 on canvas. You probably haven't heard of him because he's too cool for you.

               Spencer really likes animals. Like a lot. Like a lot a lot. He has many fond
               memories of watching animal planet and channels this into his artwork. Spencer
               holds his nature documentaries to a high standard. for instance he was very
               upset about the honey badger documentary he watched last week because it
               played to existing honey badger stereotypes instead of providing the
               hard hitting badger facts he craves.
