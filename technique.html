                Spencer works in a basement in the light of a single window and the bong that is
                always cherrying in the corner. Sometimes when he hits a roadblock in his painting
                he sits down for a good session of shoot the nazis or skyrim. He doesn't like to 
                cut his oil paints which means that they don't last as long but it produces 
                more vibrant colors and lets him play with things like texture
            </p>
            <p>
                There's also some other cool things that Spencer does that makes his
                art cool and unique and things and stuff. In general Spencer uses paintbrushes
                to put paint on canvases.

               Spencer really likes animals. Like a lot. Like a lot a lot. He has many fond
               memories of watching animal planet and channels this into his artwork. Spencer
               holds his nature documentaries to a high standard. For instance he was very
               upset about the honey badger documentary he watched last week because it
               played to existing honey badger stereotypes instead of providing the
               hard hitting badger facts he craves.
           </p>
           <p> 
               Sometimes Spencer paints things that aren't animals. Like that one time Spencer
               painted a bike wheel. It was a pretty bike wheel. The main thing is that the
               composition and the colors are engaging though. And Badger Facts. He's all about
               those Badger facts.
